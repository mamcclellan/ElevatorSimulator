# Elevator Simulator

This is a simple simulator that creates a building with a user-specified number of floors and elevators, and then creates a user-specified number of random people per minute for a certain number of minutes for the elevators to take to their destinations. There is a simple GUI for the user to specify simulation inputs. Once the user hits start, the events appear as simple timestamped text notifications in the Standard Output as they occur. 

This is not a demonstration of algorithms like many other identically-named projects on Github; my elevator algorithm is a mess and I'm surprised it works. This is much more of a demonstration of thread management in Java.
